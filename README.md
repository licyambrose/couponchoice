# couponchoice
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

**Applying the CRISP-DM methodology specifically to the "Coupon" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository**

**1. Business Understanding**
- Objective: Determine the factors that influence a driver's decision to accept or reject a coupon in different driving scenarios.
- Business Goals: Enhance marketing strategies by understanding consumer behavior and optimizing coupon distribution to increase acceptance rates.
- Key Questions: What attributes most influence coupon acceptance? How can businesses target coupons more effectively based on these attributes?

**2. Data Understanding**
- Data Overview: Examine the dataset, which includes features such as destination, current time, weather, passenger, and coupon type. Understand the response variable, where "Y = 1" indicates coupon acceptance and "Y = 0" indicates rejection.
- Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between features. Visualize data distributions and correlations to gain insights into consumer behavior.

**3. Data Preparation**
- Data Cleaning: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and correct any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features if beneficial, such as interaction terms between existing features or encoding categorical variables appropriately.
- Data Transformation: Normalize or scale numerical features and encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.
for e.g as part of this exercise 
- Duplicate records were dropped
- Missing string values were filled with 'unknown'
- Y column name was renamed to 'coupon_accepted' for clarity
- Textual values in age column were converted to numerical values (e.g., 'young' = 0, 'middle' = 1, 'old' = 2)
- for the income column we need to extract the lower limit from the string >50k filter
- 
**4. Modeling**
- Model Selection: Choose suitable algorithms for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, based on the dataset characteristics.
- Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train models using the training data and optimize hyperparameters through cross-validation.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Compare models to select the most effective one.

**5. Evaluation**
- Validation: Verify that the model meets business objectives and performs well on unseen data. Conduct further validation if necessary.
- Interpretation: Analyze model outputs to understand the impact of different features on coupon acceptance. Use techniques such as feature importance or SHAP values for detailed interpretation.
- Business Implications: Discuss how the insights gained from the model can be applied to improve coupon targeting and marketing strategies.
- What proportion of the total observations chose to accept the coupon?
Accepted coupon count: 7157
Total count: 12610
Proportion of accepted coupons: 56.76%

- What proportion of bar coupons were accepted?
Proportion of bar coupons accepted: 41.00%

- Compare the acceptance rate between those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month to those who went more.
bar_visit_group
few        0.370391
more       0.768844
unknown    0.380952

- Compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others.  Is there a difference?
Acceptance rate (bar >1/month & age>25): 69.52%
Acceptance rate (all others): 33.46%
yes there is a significant difference

- Use the same process to compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.
Acceptance rate (bar >1/month, not kid, not farming/fishing/forestry): 68.79%
Acceptance rate (all others): 29.28%

- Compare the acceptance rates between those drivers who:

- go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed *OR*
- go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 *OR*
- go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.

Acceptance rate (target group): 57.53%
Acceptance rate (all others): 29.83%

- Based on these observations, what do you hypothesize about drivers who accepted the bar coupons? 
# Based on the analysis, drivers who accepted bar coupons are more likely to:

# Visit bars more frequently (more than once a month).
# Be younger (especially under 30).
# Have passengers who are not kids.
# Not be widowed.
# Dine at cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month.
# Have a lower income (less than $50,000).
# These patterns suggest that younger, more social drivers with lower incomes and frequent dining or bar habits are more receptive to bar

**6. Deployment**
- Implementation: Deploy the chosen model into a production environment where it can be used to predict coupon acceptance in real-time or batch processing scenarios.
- Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance over time, making necessary updates to maintain accuracy and relevance.
- Documentation: Document the entire process, including data preparation, modeling decisions, and evaluation results, to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
